# Luniby Website Setup Guide

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Missing OpenAI Service Methods** - Implemented complete `openaiService.js` with:
   - `generateTriageResponse()` - AI conversation responses with streaming support
   - `generateHealthReport()` - SOAP note generation with streaming
   - Response caching for improved performance
   - Proper error handling and fallbacks

2. **Missing Triage Service Methods** - Implemented complete `triageService.js` with:
   - `analyzeCompletionCriteria()` - AI-powered criteria detection
   - Enhanced fallback analysis with keyword matching
   - Behavioral changes detection fix (addresses patch requirements)

3. **Behavioral Changes Detection Fix** - Applied comprehensive fix:
   - Recognizes "none", "no", "nothing" as valid responses
   - Properly detects when behavior information has been provided
   - Prevents re-asking about behavior once answered
   - Allows triage completion at 100% (7/7 criteria)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account (for database)
- OpenAI API key (for AI triage functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd workspace
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   
   ```env
   # Required - Supabase Configuration
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   
   # Required - OpenAI Configuration
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # Optional - Sentry (Error Tracking)
   REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
   REACT_APP_SENTRY_DEBUG=false
   
   # Optional - SendGrid (Email Notifications)
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
   
   # Optional - Twilio (SMS Notifications)
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number
   ```

3. **Get Your API Keys**

   **Supabase:**
   - Sign up at https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project
   - Go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the `URL` and `anon/public` key

   **OpenAI:**
   - Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
   - Go to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (it won't be shown again!)

   **Sentry (Optional):**
   - Sign up at https://sentry.io
   - Create a new project
   - Copy the DSN from project settings

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```
The app will run at http://localhost:3000

#### Production Build

## 🔧 Configuration

### Netlify Deployment
The site is configured for Netlify deployment via `netlify.toml`.

#### Environment Variables in Netlify:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
3. Add all required environment variables from `.env`

#### Deploy:
```bash
# Option 1: Connect GitHub repo to Netlify (recommended)
# Option 2: Manual deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Database Setup (Supabase)
The application expects the following Supabase tables:
- `user_profiles`
- `pets`
- `triage_cases`
- `health_records`
- `medical_timeline`
- `user_favorites`
- `marketplace_listings`
- `provider_profiles`

Refer to `/database/migrations/` for SQL schema files.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured" Warning
- Ensure `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Restart the development server after adding the key
- The app will work with mock responses without an API key, but AI features won't function

### "Supabase configuration missing" Warning
- Ensure `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
- Restart the development server
- The app will use mock data without Supabase configuration

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build
```

### Behavioral Changes Not Detected
This issue has been fixed! The triage system now properly recognizes:
- "none" - Valid response
- "no changes" - Valid response  
- "nothing" - Valid response
- "acting normal" - Valid response

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:
- **Lazy Loading** - Components load on demand
- **Response Streaming** - Real-time AI responses
- **Caching** - Intelligent response caching (30-min TTL)
- **Code Splitting** - Smaller initial bundle size
- **React Optimizations** - useMemo, useCallback, React.memo
- **Image Optimization** - Automatic compression

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```
