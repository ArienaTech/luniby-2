## How LuniGen AI Triage Works

### The 7-Criteria Assessment Framework

LuniGen employs a sophisticated **7-criteria assessment framework** that systematically collects essential information before providing professional-grade triage recommendations. Each criterion must be satisfied before a final assessment is made, ensuring comprehensive and accurate triage decisions:

#### 1. ⭕ **Pet Concerns** 
- **What it assesses:** Primary symptoms, health concerns, and emergency indicators
- **How it works:** 
  - AI immediately scans for emergency keywords: "difficulty breathing", "seizure", "collapse", "unconscious", "bleeding"
  - If emergency detected: Instant escalation with immediate care recommendations
  - If no emergency: Systematic collection of main symptoms and concerns
- **Clinical importance:** Forms the foundation for all subsequent assessment decisions
- **Regional adaptation:** Recognizes NZ/AU terminology ("off colour", "crook", "not right")

#### 2. ⭕ **Pet Species**
- **What it assesses:** Animal species and breed identification for species-specific care
- **How it works:**
  - Pattern recognition for dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, small mammals
  - Breed-specific considerations (e.g., brachycephalic dogs, senior cats)
  - Age-appropriate species characteristics
- **Clinical importance:** Determines species-specific normal parameters and risk factors
- **Coverage:** Domestic pets common in NZ/AU households

#### 3. ⭕ **Pet Age**
- **What it assesses:** Life stage classification for age-appropriate triage
- **How it works:**
  - Categorizes as puppy/kitten, adult, or senior
  - Age-specific vulnerability assessment
  - Life stage-appropriate health recommendations
- **Clinical importance:** Young and senior animals have different risk profiles and urgencies
- **Professional standards:** Follows veterinary age classification protocols

#### 4. ⭕ **Duration**
- **What it assesses:** Timeline of symptom onset, progression, and pattern
- **How it works:**
  - Analyzes when symptoms started ("since yesterday", "for 2 days", "just now")
  - Tracks progression (getting worse, stable, improving)
  - Identifies acute vs chronic patterns
- **Clinical importance:** Duration significantly affects severity assessment and urgency
- **Regional language:** Understands NZ/AU time expressions and patterns

#### 5. ⭕ **Eating & Drinking**
- **What it assesses:** Appetite, food intake, and hydration status
- **How it works:**
  - Evaluates appetite changes, food refusal, or normal eating
  - Assesses water intake and drinking patterns
  - Identifies dehydration risks and nutritional concerns
- **Clinical importance:** Changes in eating/drinking often indicate illness severity
- **Regional terminology:** Recognizes "off food", "off water" (common NZ/AU expressions)

#### 6. ⭕ **Behavior**
- **What it assesses:** Behavioral changes, activity level, and demeanor
- **How it works:**
  - Compares current behavior to normal baseline
  - Identifies lethargy, restlessness, hiding, aggression changes
  - Assesses mental state and alertness
- **Clinical importance:** Behavioral changes often precede physical symptoms
- **Cultural sensitivity:** Understands different owner interpretations of "normal" behavior

#### 7. ⭕ **Medical History & Care**
- **What it assesses:** Previous medical conditions, medications, and recent care
- **How it works:**
  - Reviews chronic conditions, allergies, and current medications
  - Considers recent veterinary care, vaccinations, treatments
  - Identifies relevant medical alerts and contraindications
- **Clinical importance:** Essential for safe recommendations and drug interactions
- **Integration:** Links with pet owner's medical history database when available

### Case-by-Case Assessment Process

LuniGen uses an **intelligent step-by-step approach** where each case progresses through distinct phases, ensuring no critical information is missed:

#### Phase 1: Information Gathering (0-6 criteria collected)
**Process:**
- AI asks **one targeted question at a time** to collect missing criteria
- System prevents medical assessment until ALL 7 criteria are satisfied
- Emergency detection runs continuously throughout the process
- Progress tracker shows ⭕ and ✅ for each criterion in real-time

**Example Conversation Flow:**
```
User: "My dog seems unwell"
LuniGen: "Before we continue, I need to check - is your pet experiencing any 
          emergency symptoms like difficulty breathing, collapse, severe bleeding, 
          suspected poisoning, severe pain, or signs of shock? If not, please 
          describe the main symptoms you've noticed."

User: "No emergency symptoms. He's been vomiting since yesterday."
LuniGen: ✅ Pet Concerns collected
         "What type of pet do you have and what's their breed if known?"

User: "He's a 5-year-old Golden Retriever"
LuniGen: ✅ Pet Species and ✅ Pet Age collected
         "You mentioned the vomiting started yesterday - has it been continuous, 
          or does it happen at certain times?"
```

#### Phase 2: Comprehensive Assessment (All 7 criteria ✅)
**Process:**
- Once all criteria are collected, AI performs complete triage analysis
- System synthesizes all information using veterinary clinical protocols
- Severity level determined: EMERGENCY → SERIOUS → MODERATE → MILD
- Professional SOAP notes automatically generated

**Assessment Components:**
1. **Severity Classification:** Based on symptom severity, duration, and clinical red flags
2. **Clinical Reasoning:** Explains why the severity level was chosen
3. **Immediate Actions:** What to do right now based on severity
4. **Monitoring Guidelines:** What to watch for and warning signs
5. **Timeline:** When to seek care (immediate, 2-6 hours, 12-24 hours, etc.)

#### Phase 3: Professional Documentation & Follow-up
**Process:**
- SOAP notes generated meeting NZVA/AVA documentation standards
- Case saved to pet's medical history (if logged in)
- Integration with veterinary practice systems (if connected)
- Follow-up recommendations and monitoring schedule

### Real-Time AI Processing Pipeline
