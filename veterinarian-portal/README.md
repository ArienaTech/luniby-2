- **No icons** - text-only navigation feels plain
- **Limited visual hierarchy** - could use more color/contrast
- **Basic dashboard widgets** - overview section could be richer

### **3. Workflow Enhancements**
- **No patient history** - can't track visit history
- **No treatment notes** - limited medical documentation
- **No prescription tracking** - important for follow-ups
- **No photo uploads** - useful for documentation

### **4. Advanced Features**
- **No notifications** - miss important updates
- **No reporting** - limited analytics
- **No multi-user support** - single vet only
