# Pet Business Dashboard - Product Catalog Supabase Integration

## Overview
The Product Catalog in the Pet Business Dashboard has been successfully integrated with Supabase, replacing all dummy data with real database operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`database/migrations/016_create_products_table.sql`)
- Created comprehensive `products` table with all necessary fields:
  - Basic product info (name, description, category, subcategory)
  - Pricing and inventory (price, stock_quantity)
  - Product details (brand, sku, weight, dimensions)
  - Pet-specific fields (age_group, pet_type, is_prescription)
  - Media support (image_url, images JSONB array)
  - Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, is_active)
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Configured Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Set up foreign key relationship to providers table

### 2. Product Service (`src/services/productService.js`)
Comprehensive service layer with the following methods:

#### Core CRUD Operations
- `getProducts(providerId)` - Fetch products for a specific business
- `getAllProducts()` - Fetch all public products with provider info
- `createProduct(productData)` - Create new product with validation
- `updateProduct(productId, updates)` - Update existing product
- `deleteProduct(productId)` - Soft delete product

#### Advanced Features
- `searchProducts(searchTerm, providerId)` - Search products by name/description
- `getProductsByCategory(category, providerId)` - Filter by category
- `getProductCategories(providerId)` - Get unique categories for a provider
- `getLowStockProducts(providerId, threshold)` - Get products with low stock
- `uploadProductImage(file, productId)` - Upload images to Supabase storage
- `getBusinessStats(providerId)` - Get business statistics for dashboard

### 3. Updated Components

#### ProductCatalog Component
- Replaced mock data with real Supabase integration
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented real CRUD operations for all product management functions
- Added retry functionality for failed operations
- Updated form handling to work with database schema
